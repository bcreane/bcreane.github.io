I am a software engineer with a passion for building and leading high-velocity engineering teams and exploring cutting-edge technologies.

Currently, I architect and build high-performance Golang cybersecurity web applications, and I'm always eager to explore new domains. I have diverse technical experience spanning multiple disciplines—from leading Tigera's Machine Learning team and gaining expertise in Scala, Python (Pandas), and data pipelines to delivering timely, nuanced security alerts in production environments.

## Past Roles

* **[Corelight](https://corelight.com)** - Led a team delivering a sophisticated control plane for Corelight sensors, encompassing both a Golang backend and React/TypeScript front-end.

* **[Palo Alto Networks](https://paloaltonetworks.com)** - Led a team building a Kubernetes/Golang SaaS web application platform for managing virtual and physical firewall devices.
