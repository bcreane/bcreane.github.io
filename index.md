I am a software engineer with a passion for building and leading high velocity engineering
teams and learning new and exciting technologies.

I love learning new technologies; my latest incarnation is architecting and building
high performance Golang cybersecurity web applications .. and I'm always hungry to explore
new domains. For example, I led Tigera's Machine Learning team and built domain experience
with Scala, Python (Pandas), and data pipelines in the context of delivering
timely/nuanced security alerts.
