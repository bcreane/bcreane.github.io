I work at Palo Alto Networks leading a Kubernetes infrastructure team and also a team focused on firewall cybersecurity configuration. Past roles include:
* [tigera.io](https://www.tigera.io/) on [projectcalico.org](https://www.projectcalico.org/) and [Calico Enterprise](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico-enterprise/) which provide secure networking for the cloud native era.
* Riverbed - leading the SF-based responsible for integrating a Linux-based, embedded firewall (Ocedo) into Riverbed's WAN-optimizaiton and SD-WAN product lines. 
* Apple - individual contributor building Unix device drivers for Apple's A/UX product (Apple Unix).

I love learning new technologies; my C++ / embedded Linux days still bring me joy, but now I'm mostly coding (and reviewing my team's designs / deliverables) with golang-based microservices.
