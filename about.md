I am a software engineer with a passion for building and leading high velocity engineering
teams and learning new and exciting technologies.

<img style="float: right;" src="/images/bcreane-headshot-color-small.jpg">

I work at Corelight Inc. leading two teams:
* Fleet team builds a Golang / Kubernetes appliance that manages a "Fleet" of NDR (network detection and response) "sensors".
* UI team - builds React-based Web applications, e.g. "Fleet" and "Investigator".

Past roles include:
* [PANW](paloaltonetworks.com) - lead a team that delivers a Kubernetes / Golang SaaS web application platform for managing both virtual and physical firewall devices.
* [tigera.io](https://www.tigera.io/) on [projectcalico.org](https://www.projectcalico.org/) and [Calico Enterprise](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico-enterprise/) lead the SF-based engineering team responsible for both open source Calico as well as Tigera's Enterprise SaaS - delivers real-time security posture monitoring in Kubernetes environments.
* Riverbed - lead the SF-based team responsible for integrating a Linux-based, embedded firewall into Riverbed's WAN-optimizaiton and SD-WAN product lines. 
* Apple - individual contributor building Unix device drivers for Apple's A/UX product (Apple Unix).

I love learning new technologies; my latest incarnation is architecting and building
high performance Golang cybersecurity web applications. I'm always hungry to explore new domains,
for example, I led Tigera's Machine Learning team and built domain experience with Scala,
Python, and data pipelines in the context of delivering timely/nuanced security alerts.
